/**
 *  Naive thought: Brute force. Would make removing 'eaten' cookies 
 *  more complex. ..would be easier to sort and then iterate
 * 
 *  Probably efficient solution: Sort each array, iterate through, incrementing
 *  child only when a cookie has been found for that child of sufficient size.
 * 
 *  Time Complexity: max(gLog(g),sLog(s)) for the sorting
 *  Space Complexity: O(1) assuming java sort sorts arrays in place.
